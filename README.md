# Embarassingly-Simple-ZSL-unofficial

This is an unofficial, third-party, implementation of the ICML 2015 paper entitled "An embarrassingly simple approach to zero-shot learning" (<a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v37/romera-paredes15.html">ESZSL</a>) by Bernardino Romera-Paredes and Philip Torr.

Please note that this repository was created after an unoffical demo tutorial session that I provided in front of my lab: the code is not meant to be performance-oriented, since it is didactical in scope. In fact, for an accurate historical reconstruction, I considered <a href="https://github.com/Elyorcv/SAE">GoogleNet features, class embeddings and splits</a> by the paper [Kodirov et al., Semantic Autoencoders for Zero-Shot Learning, CVPR 2017] which should match the ones used by ESZSL. I am thus not considering the recommended "Proposed Splits" by [Xian et al. Zero Shot Learning - A Comprehensive Evaluation of the Good, the Bad and the Ugly, TPAMI 18] which has to be preferred in practice, but were not simply available at the time ESZSL was published.
